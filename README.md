# BattleSimulation
## By Jered Stevens

This is a research project to find the most efficient and effective strategies to winning battles in video games, role playing games, ect.

This project focuses on simulating a very large series of conflicts, each with unique events to be decided by a random generator. The tactics will be decided prior to beginning the simulation and percentage of successful battles will be recorded. This will inform readers of the tactics used to maximize chances of success in their own endeavors.
